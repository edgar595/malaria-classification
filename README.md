Malaria Dataset Analysis and Classification
This project explores the Malaria dataset available in TensorFlow Datasets. It covers the entire workflow from data exploration to model evaluation. Below is a brief overview of what has been accomplished:

Data Exploration: Explored the Malaria dataset to understand its structure, features, and characteristics. Visualized the data to gain insights into the distribution and patterns.

Model Creation: Developed a classification model using TensorFlow to classify images into infected and uninfected categories. Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leverage spatial hierarchies present in the images.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained the classification model on the Malaria dataset and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.

Visualization: Visualized the model's performance through various plots and graphs, illustrating key metrics and performance trends during training and evaluation.

Conclusion: Successfully completed the analysis and classification of the Malaria dataset, demonstrating proficiency in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques.
