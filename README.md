This project demonstrates how to build a deep learning model to classify cell images as infected or parasitized. It utilizes TensorFlow and the Keras API in Python. The model is trained on the Malaria Cell Images Dataset and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between parasitized and uninfected cells.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains cell images categorized into two classes: Parasitized and Uninfected. These images are used for training and testing the model.
